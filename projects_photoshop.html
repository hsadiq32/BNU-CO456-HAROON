                    <p class="projects_textbox3">I have chosen to pursue a role as a hybrid designer due to my extensive knowledge in graphic design and my passion for computer science. Software has evolved rapidly from the primitive command-line interface to now visually pleasing
                        graphical user interfaces. Microsoft Windows is a great example of this; starting as MSDOS – a complete command-line interface operating system, consumer computers in the 1980s were overwhelming in functions, essentially making
                        the average user learn an amplitude of commands and code syntax to do even the simplest tasks (Everett 2008). It came to the point where third-party developers were coding their own easier to use interfaces to overcome the complex
                        environment MS-DOS originally created. Eventually, Microsoft took notice of this, iteration by iteration Microsoft added more GUI corresponding elements unit they came up with Windows. An operating system moulded around a new GUI
                        which allowed multitasking and not having the burden to remember 500 lines of commands to use the OS.<br><br>Apples first iPhone shows the importance of this link of visual and computational design. The first iPhone was a revolutionary
                        piece of technology, yet the internal hardware was nothing new. So, what made Apple's first phone innovative? It was user interface of the iPhone which brought the experience together, finding percipient ways for the user to interact
                        with software was Apple's main goal, creating a simplistic yet utilitarian user environment. The home screen looked easy to navigate through yet could execute many functions, it’s refreshing GUI is complemented directly by its
                        streamlined native code. From a business standpoint, consumers overwhelmingly responded to this with the iPhone reaching 6.1 million sales in its first five quarters, therefore showing the importance of a frictionless user experience
                        in balance of well-coded software. This combination of unifying backend code with an easy-to-use interface has spread and evolved across the modern platforms we see today; Windows, Android, Linux and more.<br><br>&nbsp;Looking
                        at the current industry, Hybrid Designers can stem in many directions, being only bounded by the coding language to create a graphical environment. Communication with clients is essential, especially since both the back and front-end
                        design are worked in conjunction. Because of this, getting the client's vision requires constant revisions and feedback with a clear and concise development plan. In addition, Data and analytics are becoming the new currency in
                        a technology-centric society, using this information Hybrid Designers can fine-tune designs and features to fit the overall demographic to produce a better product. In conclusion, a well-coded program can run well but is useless
                        if the user does not know how to operate it, therefore interlinking both graphics and computer science into a job role transmogrifies the before broken bridge between a user interface and back end code, making a hybrid designer
                        a truly lucrative job role – virtually two jobs combined into one.<br>
